# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: "this" is used as a way to call on an object. I've used this in classes, inheritance and in React. For example when we want to call on a certain object we do this.nameOfObject

  Researched answer: "this" is a javascript keyword that refers to an object.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React was created by Facebook and is used to build webpages or applications. react is component based, that means it is used to build small parts and join them all together to build an app or webpage. React is very efficient in the way that it is not repetive, it can be used again and it helps the code look less crowded. I have used in a project that it was meant to traslate words from english to pig latin. I would definietly use it again to make a web page, specially top build a portfolio

  Researched answer: React is used to buil webpages, mobile web pages, and native movile apps. It's component based that means we use it to build many small parts and then join them together to form entire applications.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: render is required in a React class component and it renders, gives or provides the JSX code. There is also return which returns what we give inside of the parentheses.
  Researched answer: Render only works in smart class components, it renders the JSX to display the code that goes within our epmty div. In React, when working with smart components, we need the JSX to live inside a single tag, which goes inside the return(), which lives inside the render(){}.



4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX I belive was created by Facebook as well and its a combination between Javascript and HTML. While looking at the difference between and HTML and JSX I've noticed that jsx is more complex but more efficent. HTML is easier to undestand and play around woith but I believe it takes twice the time and effort to write and transfer all the JS files.  

  Researched answer: JSX is JavaScript flavored HTML that behaves almost like HTML. JSX uses the syntax className rather than HTML's class because class is reserved for HTML. 



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn its a package manager. I've used it a couple of times while working on react. What it does is that it downloads files so it can run your code. 

  Researched answer: yarn is a package manager that allows you to run code and share it with other developers.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I believe an anonymous function has the purpose to define something that is not defined yet. 

  Researched answer: anonymous functions allow the creation of functions which have no specific name.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false.

2. Object-oriented programming: OOP focuses on objects rather than functions and logic. "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior"

3. Ruby: Ruby is object orineted and supposedly simple. "Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted, dynamically-typed, server-side scripting language. Ruby has many helpful built in methods and great documentation."


4. Ruby blocks: Ruby has anonymous functions similar to JavaScript. They are called blocks. Blocks can be created with the do/end keywords OR with {}. Blocks are code that is passed to a method.

5. Ruby hashes: A hash is a container for data. The data in a hash are stored in key:value pairs.
